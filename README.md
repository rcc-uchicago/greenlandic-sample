# Greenlandic Dataset

*A small dataset containing Greenlandic language samples for database
prototyping.*

---

Lenore Grenoble's students would like the RCC to host similar datasets with a
basic web-frontend for data viewing/importing/exporting.  We're currently experimenting with a simple sqlite backend and a minimalist web-frontend for simple querying.


### Usage

Assuming you have `sqlite3` and `node` installed:

    npm install     # install dependencies
    npm run init    # initialize the database
    npm run demo    # print a list of tables in the database
